As a developer, have you ever wanted to look up what day of the week a particular day falls on or find
the duration between two dates right from your terminal? Well, wait no more because this CLI utility
provides you with just that!

Right now, the project's still a WIP, but I hope to add these two features soon.

# Setup

1. Fork this repository and clone it.

2. Install Python 3.8+ from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Create a virtual environment using the Python `venv` module:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
4. Activate the virtual environment through the `activate` command:

MacOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

> NOTE: To find out more about Python virtual environment, you can refer to the [`venv` documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

5. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Execute the `main.py` Python script to see all the CLI options:
```bash
python main.py
```
